There are many financial products related to vehicles. Auto loans and auto leases are the most common ones. But there is a third financial product related to vehicles which is just as useful but half as well known as the previously named ones: auto title loans. An auto title loan is a very versatile type of loan which works very much like a payday loan, with the only difference that it belongs to the secured loan group.

This article focuses on car title loans, it is an explication on their very nature, on what they entail as financial products and on the obligatory requirements for approval.

Car Title Loans

This type of loan is, as stated before on this article, a secured loan. You borrow a sum of money by pledging your car as a security for the loan. The amount of money you can apply for ranges between $601 and $2500 more or less. As you can see, this loan can be compared to a secured form of a payday loan. It is also a short-term loan, usually lasting between 15 and 30 days at most. If you fail to repay it at the end of the loan, you will be able to "roll it over". If "rolled" over, the interest rate on the loan will accumulate.
